# converting .ppm files to other files

This script can effectively convert ANY image files to ANY other imagefiles.

It's simply using the pillow library to convert images.

# quick start

```console
python convert.py
```

make sure you have pillow in your python environment
```console
pip install pillow
```

keep in mind the filesize of the .ppm images in this repo are massive in filesize.
```console
du -sh images/
452M    images/
```

use the lightweight branch if you don't want to pull with all the images.
